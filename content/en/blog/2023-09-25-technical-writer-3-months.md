It's been three months since I got a full-time job as a technical writer. So I think it's time to writing something about it.

## How I got this job?

The story is simple. One day, I got an email from the HR department of a company asking me if I'm interested in a technical writer job. 

```
Hi Huanlin,
Good day!

This is OOO , Talent Acquisition Specialist from OOO HQ.
We are impressed by your experience, wondering if you would be 
interested in our Technical Writer position?

Here's JD for your reference:Â https://...
 
If yes, our IT manager would like to invite you to hava a formal 
inteview and you could know more about this role and the vision.
 
For any question, do feel free to reach me and we look forward to 
hearing from you!
```

That email was sent from a semiconductor manufacturing company based in Taiwan. It's also an international company, a big one.

After some interview process, about two months if I remembered correctly, I got the offer letter.

Before I got this job, I've been worked as a freelancer for about 7 years, and have been writing blogs and e-books about software programming for more than 10 years. Although I've never asked the IT manager who recruited me, I think it's my blog posts and published e-books that helped me got this job. 

Based on my skills and experiences, I thought it should not be no sweat for me to be a full-time technical writer. Well, I was naive.

## What I learned

- Communication & learning
- English writing skill

### Communication & Learning

The first thing I learned is communication. I mean lots of communication.

I am a person who enjoy working and eating alone. Yet here I am, working as a technical writer, asking questions to collegues almost everyday. The team I worked with is a DevOps team, and the members are always busy developing, deploying, or fixing something. Sometimes I just felt that I should not distrub them, but I have to. So I can't say that I enjoyed this situation.

In addition, the first documentation project that assigned to me is all about data center management, which is totally new to me. I have to learn many terms so that I can understand what my collegues were talking about, then I can start writing something about it. 

If I don't understand it, I can't write a good document for it.

I'm not complaining here. Just stat the fact that it was quite a challenge to me. The old dog has to play new tricks. So keep learning is also essential for this job.

## English Writing Skill

The second thing that I learned is I need to improve my English writing skill as fast as I can. 

In the first two months, I was writing documents with Chinese. Then one day, my supervisor told me that his boss prefers English documents. Since that day, I started writing documents in English. That's when I found it's urgent to improve my English writing skill. 

Yes, there are AI translation tools that I can use for translating Chinese text to English. But the translation process still takes time. Obviously, it's best if I can think in English and write in English fluently. However, when I write in English, it's a slow and painful process to me. I kept scratching my head trying to find appropriate words, and I am not confident with the sentences I wrote.

That's the reason I start writing blog posts in English. Although it's slow and painful to me, I think it's just a process and I have to go through this stage until I get used to it and be able to write in English fast enough.

## Types of Documents

By the time I wrote this post, I was working on documents for two product teams, and just about to work with the third product team for their documents.

So far I've written the following types of documents:

- User guides and tutorials for web applications.
- Web API references and tutorials.

## Document as Code

Markdown, GitLab Pages. Hugo with Docsy.

## Conclusion

Working at this company is the best thing that happened to me in recent 10 years. I've learned a lot even I've just work here for three months. By the way, I've lost 7 kg so far. 

Just thrive to survive and see how far I can go.
