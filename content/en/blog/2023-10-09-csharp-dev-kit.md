C# Dev Kit is a Visual Studio extension to enhance C# development in Visual Studio Code. This extension is based on the C# extension and can work with the following extensions:

- [IntelliCode for C# Dev Kit](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.vscodeintellicode-csharp) (automatically installed with C# Dev Kit)
- [.NET MAUI extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.dotnet-maui)
- [Unity extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=VisualStudioToolsForUnity.vstuc)

Something you need to know about C# Dev Kit:

- It's not open-sourced.
- It's free for personal, academic, and open-source projects. 
- For commercial projects, it's free for teams of up to 5 members. For teams of 6 or more develpersm, they must have a Visual Studio Professional or higher subscription.

The following video shows how to login you Visual Studio subscription in VS Code:

I've also created a video to show how to create and run a Hello World C# project in VS Code:

From now on, it will be easier to develop and test C# applications with Visual Studio Code.
