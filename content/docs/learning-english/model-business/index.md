## 逗號 {#comma}

使用逗號可以分隔片語和子句，讓訊息更容易閱讀。

例句一：

> We have five different models, each with its own special features.
>
> 我們有五種款式，每一個都有自己的特點。

例句二：

> Although I agree with the points you mention, I would like clarification on various issues.
>
> 雖然我同意你提到的重點，但我想要釐清各項問題。

逗號會影響閱讀時的停頓和語氣，如何使用逗號並沒有絕對標準，主要是品味和風格的問題。但有一件事可以確定：千萬別濫用逗號。看看以下的例子:

> Unfortunately, if we invest in new machinery, and the market falls again. as it has been predicted, we may, possibly, find ourselves with too much production capacity, and this may, therefore, result in even more serious problems.
>
> 遺憾的是，如果我們投資新機具，而市場一如先前的預測再次下挫，那麼我們可能會產能過剩，而可能導致更嚴重的問題。

這個句子裡的所有逗號都擺對了位置，但是逗號實在太多，讓整個句子很紊亂。此外，句子也太長了。在現今的商業寫作中，應該讓句子保持簡短，並減少非必要的逗號。例如:

> We must give serious consideration to the issue of investing in new machinery. If the market falls again, as has been predicted, we could find ourselves with increased production capacity. This may then result in even more difficulties.
>
> 我們必須慎重考慮投資新機具的問題。假設一如先前的預期，市場再次下挫，我們可能會產能過剩，而可能造成更多難題。

### 常見的逗號謬誤

逗號謬誤是指兩個主要子句之間只用一個逗號連接，而實際上一個逗號卻不夠。看看以下的例子:

> It was great to see you last week, thanks for your hospitality.
>
> 上週很高興看到你，謝謝你的款待。

這是不正確的。它們是兩個完整的句子，兩個完整的想法，所以中間的逗號應該改成句號:

> It was great to see you last week. Thanks for your hospitality.
>
> 上週很高興看到你。謝謝你的款待。

這裡的另一個線索是 Thanks 這個字，除非它跟在 and、so、but 等連接詞後面，否則一向是在句首，如下所示：

> It was great to see you last week, and thanks for your hospitality.
>
> 上週很高興看到你，還有，謝謝你的款待。

> 以上例句，右邊的不見得永遠都是最合適的。有時候，某些正式的文書可能適合比較嚴肅甚至老套的語氣。

## 被動語態

一般建議是盡量使用主動語態，這樣語氣會更生動、意思更清楚。但有些場合更適合採用被動語態，則還是該用。
