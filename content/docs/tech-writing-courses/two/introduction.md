# Technical Writing Two Introduction

Technical Writing Two helps technical people improve their technical communication skills.

## Target Audience

We've aimed this course at people who have completed [Technical Writing One](https://developers.google.com/tech-writing/one) and are still hungry for more technical writing training. If you've never taken any technical writing training, we recommend completing Technical Writing One before taking this class.

## Learning Objectives

This course focuses on several intermediate topics in technical writing. After completing this class, you will know how to do the following:

- Choose among several different tactics to write first drafts and additional tactics for writing second and third drafts.
- Use several techniques to detect mistakes in your own writing.
- Organize large documents.
- Introduce a document's scope and any prerequisites.
- Write clear figure captions.
- Pick the proper information density in technical illustrations.
- Focus the reader's attention in illustrations.
- Establish context through a "big picture" illustration.
- Revise technical illustrations effectively.
- Create useful, accurate, concise, clear, reusable, and well-commented sample code that demonstrates a range of complexity.
- Identify different documentation types.
- Describe just about anything.
- Empathize with a beginner audience and write a tutorial for them.

It takes years of focused practice to become a great engineer or a great technical writer. This course will improve your technical writing but will not instantly transform you into a great technical writer.
