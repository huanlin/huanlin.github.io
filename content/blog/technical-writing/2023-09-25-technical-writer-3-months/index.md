It's been three months since I got a full-time job as a technical writer. So I think it's time to write something about it.

## How I got this job?

The story is simple. One day, I got an email from the HR department of a company asking me if I'm interested in a technical writer job. 

After some interview processes, about two months if I remembered correctly, I got the offer letter.

Before I got this job, I had been working as a freelancer for about 7 years, and had been writing blogs and e-books about software programming for more than 10 years. Although I never asked the IT manager who recruited me, I think it's my blog posts and published e-books that helped me get this job. 

Based on my skills and experiences, I thought being a full-time technical writer would be a breeze. Well, I was naive.

## What I've learned

During the three months, I've learned the following things are important:

- Communication & learning
- English writing skill
- Being a tester and user

Let me explain.

### Communication & Learning

Writing itself is a form of communication with readers. But before that, as a technical writer, I have to communicate with teams big time.

I am a person who enjoys working and dining alone. Yet here I am, asking questions to colleagues almost everyday. The team I collaborate with is a DevOps team, and its members are always busy developing, deploying, or fixing something. Sometimes I just felt that I shouldn't interrupt them, but I have to. After all, if I don't understand it, I can't write a good document for it.

In addition, my first documentation project was all about data center management and automation, which was entirely new territory for me. I have to learn many terms to comprehend what my colleagues were discussing, and ask questions such as how this feature works, what are those fields for, where I can find relevant information..., etc. The process of gathering information was just like putting together a puzzle. 

I'm not complaining; just saying that it was quite a challenge. The old dog has to play new tricks. So keep learning is essential for this job.

After three months, I felt that my communication with the team is getting better. Some team members start to inform me when new features are being designed or implemented, so that I can keep up with their pace. 

## English Writing Skill

The second thing I learned is that I need to improve my English writing skill as quickly as possible. 

In the first two months, I was writing documents in Chinese. Then, one day, my supervisor told me that his boss prefers English documents. Since that day, I started writing documents in English and soon realized that my English writing skills were far from sufficient. 

Yes, there are AI translation tools that I can use for translating Chinese text to English. But the translation process still takes time. Obviously, it's best if I can think in English and write in English fluently. However, when I write in English, it's a slow and challenging process for me. I find myself scratching my head, trying to find the appropriate words, and I lack confidence in the sentences I wrote.

That's the reason I started writing blog posts in English. Although it's a slow and challenging process for me, I believe it's just a stage I have to go through until I get used to it and can write correct English more quickly.

## Being a Tester and a User

Yes, I'm also a tester and a user, at least in part. Just as mentioned earlier, if I don't understand it, I can't write a good document for it. So before I can write the document, I have to be a tester and a user.

Because of this, I was not only asking questions but also be able to provide suggestions to development teams, such as bug reports, UI/UX improvement suggestions, wording..., etc. I think it's a positive feedback loop that can benefit both the product and the documentation. Sometimes my suggestions were ignored or not accepted by the team, but that's not a big deal. I understand that sometimes people are too busy to care about the little things. I just move on and keep writing.

## Types of Documents

By the time I wrote this post, I was working on documents for two product teams, and just about to work with the third product team for their documents.

So far I've written the following types of documents:

- User guides and tutorials for web applications.
- Web API references and tutorials.

## Document as Code

Markdown, GitLab Pages. Hugo with Docsy.

## Conclusion

Working at this company is the best thing that happened to me in recent 10 years. I've learned a lot even I've worked here for just three months. By the way, I've lost 7 kg so far. 

Just strive to survive and see how far I can go.
